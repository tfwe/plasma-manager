# Preface {#preface}
Plasma Manager is a [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
module capable of configuring as much of KDE Plasma as
possible, using [Nix](https://nixos.org).

The project has progressed a lot lately, to the extent where
[most of the configuration options present in KDE Plasma 6 are configurable through `plasma-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/plasma-manager#whats-supported).

The main focus of the project has been on KDE Plasma 6 for a little while now,
but it's also possible to use it to some extent on Plasma 5 as well.
